This is an alternative way to setup a Gutenberg raw file for the 03-Markup Project using VS Code (Instead of the MS Word workflow).

**Important difference:** In Word, we will use a paragraph symbol ```^p```, but in VS Code, we will use a ```\n``` new line character.

We are going to discuss [Mark Up Languages](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-are-markup-languages-3468655) in this class, but Markdown, is gaining a lot of popularity. This page is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
