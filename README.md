# vs-code-search-replace

This is an alternative way to setup a Gutenberg file for the 03-Markup Project using VS Code instead of the MS Word workflow.

We will download this file so you can see how the steps that we take in the Word will also work in text editors that can work with regular expressions.

In Word, we will use a paragraph symbol, but in VS Code, we will use a ```\n``` new line character.
